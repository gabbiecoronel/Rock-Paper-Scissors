This was my first coding project that I created on my own. I practiced using key concepts in programming such as input, output, variables, loops, lists, and strings. In this code, I refer to Petey who's one of the mascots at the University of Central Florida (UCF). My code first displays the different weapons (R - Rock, P - Paper, S - Scissors), and asks the user to choose a weapon. If the user doesn't type one of the listed weapons, the program says "That's not an option" and goes back to the list of weapons. Once the user chooses a weapon, the code prints the chosen weapon along with the weapon that Petey chose. Petey's weapon is determined by randomization. After, a print statement will appear indicating if you won, lost, or tied to Petey. Finally, my code asks the user if they want to play again and displays the two options (Yes or No). The game will continue as long as the user enters "Yes". If the user enters "No", then the program prints "Goodbye" and ends.
